	 	My name is Mimi Nguyen, and I moved to the US from Vietnam in 2013. I'm currently a BFA Photogrphy major student at San Jose State Univeristy, and I work as a photographer for Bella Baby Photography. 
		
			As a photographer, I find photography a unique language of art that is communicated by humans' perspective and feelings. After four years pursuing photography, portraiture is which I choose to master. The more moments I capture, the more valuable I find in portrait photography.
